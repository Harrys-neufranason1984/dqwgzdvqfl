OMG, just finished watching The Legend of Ochi and I legit don't even know how to feel right now. It's like I’m emotionally wiped but in a good way? That movie is all kinds of wild. Like, who came up with that storyline? My brain is still trying to wrap itself around it. I had to download the movie because everyone kept talking about it and now I get why lol.

So, like, the visuals were totally stunning, right? I mean, I was just sitting there with my jaw on the floor half the time. It’s the kinda movie that makes you wish you were inside it, just living in that crazy beautiful world. Ochi is such a vibe - adorable yet kinda fierce? You know what I mean? And the music, argh, don't even get me started. Goosebumps central, seriously 😲.

But also, what was even happening with that plot? One minute I'm totally getting it and the next I'm like, wait, whattt? Anyway, maybe it was just me being tired. Kept jumping from one thing to the next. Maybe I need to watch the movie again to actually get the full picture. 😅

> Also, I can't stop replaying that one scene in my head, you know the one I mean. Just ughhh, so good. But then there were parts where I was like, “Okay, this is dragging on a bit.” Maybe they could've trimmed a scene or two? Or maybe that's just my late-night brain being impatient.

False alarm, sorry. Man, I could use some coffee right now, that’s for sure. 😂 So many feels tho. But it’s a movie that’s gonna stick with ya, that’s for certain. A bit like a rollercoaster but more artsy. Might need a day or two to process this whole thing.

int totallyRandom = 42; // why did I just type this? 🤷

Anyway, how have you been? Seen any good movies lately? 😄
